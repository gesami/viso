Monocular SLAM implementation, i.e. simultaneous localization and mapping with only one camera, inspired by the [SVO paper](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:e9b12a61-5dc8-48d2-a5f6-bd8ab49d1986/ICRA14_Forster.pdf).

Configurations like dataset directory and intrinstics parameters are set in the /data/default.yaml file. The reading sequence is specified in the rgb.txt in the dataset and the estimated trajectory will be recorded in the estimation.txt.
